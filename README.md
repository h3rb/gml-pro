gml-pro
=======

A large collection of shaders, images and utility functions for GameMaker Studio 1.2+
All shaders written for OpenGL GLSL ES

IF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS PLEASE STAR THE PROJECT ON GITHUB, THANKS!

__How to use this stuff__

This is in no way a complete game.  You are best advised to pick through it, and decide what you want to use, then either copy it over to your existing project, or cut GML-Pro down in size until you've got only what you need, because it does slow down your compile times.

Recent changes:

- Audio section recently updated and bugs fixed.
- No longer serving a GMZ, we are now serving a GMX folder
- Updated to work flawlessly for GMS2, but remains an importable GMZ for legacy compatibility

  Integration and this License:
 
  Note: you may integrate this pack into your GameMaker projects, including commercial ones.  
  
  To comply with this license you should credit
  "H. Elwood Gilliland III" in your game's credits, tagged with 
  "GML Pro Pack Contributor" or "Contributing Programmer" or simply "Programmer"
  
  If you make minor changes to the library, you do not need to release these under
  the ShareAlike clause unless they are solely an improvement to the overall Library.
  
  You do not need to ShareAlike your entire game application.
  
  The License covers:
   Datasets, Images, Audio, GML Source Code, GLSL Source Code, Documentation
   
   In regards to CRT1,CRT2, and some other third-parties cited in the GLSL source
   code.  Many comments were removed from the source code, or shortened, to expedite
   the compilation process.  Because of this, I share the following statement:
   Some shaders were based on shaders provided to the public domain by Themaister
   and also the author of mari0, someone named DOLLS, a person named cgwg, and a
   few other "anonymous copyright holders" -- and have various licenses.  GPL was
   offered as a license, but many of them are based on the work of other authors,
   and we're not sure who they were.  HQ4X for instance is an implementation of
   a technique discussed in a Siggraph paper, and some of the other shaders are
   merely knockoffs of either HQ4X or the Bloom shader.  All of them utilize widely
   adopted and common techniques.  Use them at your own discretion, but I am
   presenting this background information on the legality of certain shaders contained
   within this project.  My license covers my work, which includes a majority of the
   shaders, and a majority of the functions excluding public domain and accredited
   licenses mentioned herein.
   
   This project also contains the work of the CDNA author, and my own work in Adobe Photoshop.
   I also have included a few sound files which either I acted myself, created with my
   professionally licensed studio software, contracted through Voices.com, or purchased royalty
   free redistribution licenses to, and have included them in this project.  My audio partnerships
   have included ProducerLoops.com, Strangesoft and a few indie performers.
